## Development Decision Records

### **June 30, 2025 - Human-in-the-Loop Component Removal**

**Issue**: Initial CommitData structure included human-in-the-loop fields (`requires_human_input`, `suggested_questions`) which created architectural confusion about where interaction logic belonged.

**Decision**: Removed these fields from CommitData and moved human interaction responsibility to LangGraph state management and dedicated nodes.

**Reasoning**: Data structures should represent pure data, not workflow control. Human-in-the-loop is a workflow concern that belongs in the LangGraph orchestration layer, not in the data models returned by tools. This separation of concerns makes the architecture cleaner and more maintainable.

### **June 30, 2025 - Ghost CMS vs Notion Platform Choice**

**Issue**: Needed to choose between Ghost CMS and Notion for blog publishing platform integration.

**Decision**: Chose Ghost CMS over Notion for BlueStar blog publishing.

**Reasoning**: Ghost is purpose-built for publishing with superior SEO features, clean APIs, and straightforward content model. Notion's block-based architecture would require complex content transformation and lacks publishing-focused features like meta descriptions, canonical URLs, and social media optimization. Ghost's HTML-based content model aligns perfectly with LLM-generated content, while Notion's nested block structure would add unnecessary complexity for blog generation workflows.

### **June 30, 2025 - BlogOutline Generation Phase Removal**

**Issue**: Initial architecture included BlogOutline as intermediate planning step between CommitAnalysis and content generation, requiring separate OutlineGenerator node and additional LLM call.

**Decision**: Completely removed BlogOutline class and direct outline generation phase.

**Reasoning**: BlogOutline added unnecessary complexity without significant quality improvement. CommitAnalysis already contains sufficient planning information (summary, key_changes, technical_details, narrative_angle) for direct blog post generation. Eliminating the outline step reduces LLM calls by 50%, decreases latency, removes potential failure points, and simplifies the architecture while maintaining content quality through the existing analysis structure.

**Impact**: 
- Reduced workflow from 2+ LLM calls to 1 call
- Simplified data flow: `CommitData → CommitAnalysis → GhostBlogPost`
- Eliminated unnecessary `BlogOutline` and `OutlineGenerator` components

## Architecture Evolution Summary

**Original Workflow**: 
```
CommitData → CommitAnalysis → BlogOutline → List[BlogSection] → GhostBlogPost
```

**Simplified Workflow**:
```
CommitData → CommitAnalysis → GhostBlogPost
```

**Key Principles Established**:
- Separation of concerns (data vs. workflow logic)
- Cost efficiency (minimize LLM calls)
- Platform alignment (choose tools built for purpose)
- Architectural simplicity (eliminate unnecessary complexity)

### **January 20, 2025 - CommitFetcher Architecture: API-First for MCP Distribution**

**Issue**: Initial development plan specified local Git CLI approach for commit data extraction, but this created significant barriers for MCP server distribution and user adoption.

**Decision**: Switched to GitHub API-first approach with local Git CLI as Phase 2 fallback option.

**Reasoning**: 
- **MCP Distribution**: API-first eliminates local dependencies (Git CLI installation, repository access) that complicate MCP server deployment
- **User Experience**: Simple GitHub token configuration vs complex path setup and Git CLI requirements
- **Coverage**: GitHub hosts 90%+ of development projects, making API approach cover primary use cases
- **Security Model**: Better security boundaries for distributed MCP servers vs local file system access
- **Scalability**: Built-in rate limiting and batch processing capabilities through GitHub API

**Impact**:
- **Phase 1**: GitHub API implementation (primary path)
- **Phase 2**: Local Git CLI support (fallback for self-hosted repos)
- **Configuration**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` required, `BLUESTAR_ALLOW_LOCAL_GIT` optional
- **Architecture**: Hybrid detection system (API vs local) for maximum flexibility

**Technical Benefits**:
- Eliminates external MCP server dependencies (e.g., cli-mcp-server)
- Works out-of-the-box for most users without local setup
- Provides clear upgrade path for advanced use cases
- Aligns with modern development workflows (hosted repositories)
