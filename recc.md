My Architectural Recommendation üèóÔ∏è
Combining all three approaches in a progressive enhancement strategy:
Phase 1: Minimal Baseline (Immediate)
Apply to commit_data....
class CommitAnalysis(BaseModel):
    # Core fields that work with just commit message + diffs
    commit_types: List[str]
    summary: str  
    key_changes: List[str]
    technical_highlights: List[str]
    narrative_angle: str
    # Rest are optional...
Phase 2: Enhanced GitHub API (Current Enhancement)
Repository structure analysis
Key configuration files
Project type detection
Framework identification
Phase 3: User Context Integration (Next)
Optional user context during input
LLM decides when to populate enhanced fields
Graceful degradation when context is missing
Phase 4: Smart Human-in-the-Loop (Future)
Context assessment during analysis
Targeted questions when needed
Progressive context building
This approach gives us:
‚úÖ Immediate functionality with basic analysis
‚úÖ Enhanced context from GitHub API automatically
‚úÖ User-driven enhancement when they have more info
‚úÖ Smart assistance asking for context when it would genuinely help
