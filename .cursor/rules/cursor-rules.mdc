# General Rules

- **Language**: Respond in the same language as the user's query (e.g., English for English queries, Korean for Korean queries).
- **Code Changes**: Wait for explicit permission before making major code changes.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Implement changes incrementally (one component or logical unit at a time). Always pause and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding to the next step.
